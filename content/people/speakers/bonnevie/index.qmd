## About

Dr. Tora Bonnevie is an associate professor at the JCA, KISN and INB. She co-leads a work package of the JCA in collaboration with prof Christian Doeller. Her research focuses on the neurophysiology of memory, time and space, in the healthy brain and in clinical conditions. Her current research addresses how early pathology of Alzheimer’s disease affects neural processing that underpins memory functions, and causes early memory symptoms of the disease.

## Research Interests

- Neuroscience of space, time and memory
- Pathophysiology of memory disorders
- Space, time and memory in Alzheimer’s disease – linking cognition and neurophysiology
