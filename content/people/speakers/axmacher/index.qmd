## About

Prof. Nikolai Axmacher is a leading neuroscientist at Ruhr University Bochum, specializing in the neurocognitive basis of memory. His research combines advanced electrophysiological approaches with cognitive neuroscience to understand memory processes and their alterations in neurological conditions.

## Research Interests

- Neural mechanisms of human memory formation
- Electrophysiological signatures of cognitive processes
- Early biomarkers of neurodegeneration
- Clinical applications in memory disorders

## Recent Research

His current work focuses on understanding how entorhinal functioning changes in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Using advanced electrophysiological techniques, his team investigates neural signatures that might serve as early indicators of cognitive decline.
