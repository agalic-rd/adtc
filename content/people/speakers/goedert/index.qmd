## About

Prof. Michel Goedert is a distinguished molecular biologist and neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge. He is renowned for his groundbreaking research on tau proteins and their role in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. His work has been instrumental in understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

## Research Interests

- Molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration
- Tau protein aggregation and filament formation
- Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
- Structure and function of disease-associated protein assemblies

## Recent Research

His research focuses on understanding how tau proteins form abnormal filaments in neurodegenerative diseases. Using advanced techniques like cryo-electron microscopy, his work has revealed the atomic structures of tau filaments from the brains of individuals with various neurodegenerative diseases, providing crucial insights into disease mechanisms.
