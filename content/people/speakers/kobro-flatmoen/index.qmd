## About

Dr. Asgeir Kobro-Flatmoen is a neuroscientist at the National Union Dementia Centre and KISN at NTNU. His research focuses on understanding the cellular mechanisms that underlie selective neuronal vulnerability in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

## Research Interests

- Cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration
- Early markers of neural dysfunction
- Selective vulnerability in AD
- Therapeutic targeting strategies

## Recent Research

His current work investigates the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make specific neurons particularly vulnerable in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This research aims to identify potential therapeutic targets and develop strategies for early intervention.
