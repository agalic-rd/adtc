## About

Prof. Christian Döller is a renowned neuroscientist and expert in brain imaging and structural analyses. He is a Professor at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig and holds a joint appointment at JCA/KISN. His research focuses on understanding how the brain represents space, time and memory.

## Research Interests

- Advanced neuroimaging techniques for studying memory systems
- Structural and functional analysis of brain regions involved in spatial navigation
- Neural mechanisms of episodic memory
- Computational models of memory and navigation

## Recent Research

His current research combines cutting-edge neuroimaging methods with virtual reality to investigate how the brain's structural and functional architecture supports spatial navigation and memory. He has made significant contributions to understanding how the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex work together to create cognitive maps of space and memory.
