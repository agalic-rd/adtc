## About

Prof. May-Britt Moser is a Nobel laureate and co-director of the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience. Her pioneering work on grid cells and spatial representation earned her the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, shared with Edvard Moser and John O'Keefe.

## Research Interests

- Neural basis of spatial navigation
- Grid cell networks
- Memory formation and processing
- Systems neuroscience

## Recent Research

Her current research investigates how spatial location and memory are computed in neural networks. Her work continues to advance our understanding of the brain's navigational systems and their relationship to memory and cognition.
