## About

Prof. Claudia Almeida is a cell biologist at NOVA Medical School, specializing in endosomal dysfunction and its role in Alzheimer's disease. Her research has revealed important mechanisms linking endosomal function to beta-amyloid accumulation.

## Research Interests

- Endosomal dysfunction in AD
- Intraneuronal beta-amyloid
- Cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration
- Late-onset AD pathogenesis
