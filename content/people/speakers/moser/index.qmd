## About

Prof. Edvard Moser is a Nobel laureate and co-director of the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience. His groundbreaking work on grid cells and the brain's positioning system earned him the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, shared with May-Britt Moser and John O'Keefe.

## Research Interests

- Neural circuits for spatial representation
- Grid cell function and computation
- Memory formation and recall
- Systems neuroscience

## Recent Research

His current research focuses on understanding how spatial location and memory are computed in neural networks. His work continues to reveal fundamental principles about how the brain calculates position and navigates through space.
