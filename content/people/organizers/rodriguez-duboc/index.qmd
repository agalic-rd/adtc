## About

Trained as a general physician and passionate about research, I then obtained my PhD in the field of cellular and molecular neurosciences. My PhD project was focused on cerebellar development and apnea of prematurity.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, developing a new model to better understand the initiation of Alzheimer's disease.
