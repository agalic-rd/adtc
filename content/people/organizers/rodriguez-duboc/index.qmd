## About

Trained as a general physician and passionate about research, I then obtained my PhD in the field of cellular and molecular neurosciences. My PhD project was focused on cerebellar development and apnea of prematurity.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, developing a new model to better understand the initiation of Alzheimer's disease.

## Research Interests

- Translational research
- Alzheimer's disease
- In vitro models
- Oxidative stress

## Recent Research

Developping an in-vitro model of Alzheimer's disease to study early pathogenesis.
