## About

Dr. Rodriguez-Duboc obtained her PhD in the field of cellular and molecular neurosciences. Her research focused on cerebellar development and apnea of prematurity with an emphasis on oxidative stress and transcriptomic regulations.

She is currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, developing a new in-vitro model to better understand the initiation of Alzheimer's disease and the associated molecular pathways.

## Research Interests

- Translational research
- Alzheimer's disease
- In vitro models
- Oxidative stress
- Transcriptomics

## Recent Research

Developping an in-vitro model of Alzheimer's disease to study early pathogenesis.
