abstract: |
    **Background:** Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with the risk of cognitive decline and
    dementia. However, it remains unclear whether cardiovascular risk scores can effectively
    predict cognitive outcomes and whether sex influence this association. This study aimed to
    investigate the relationship between the NORRISK2 score, a cardiovascular risk score widely
    used in Norway, and the development of dementia or cognitive impairment (mild cognitive
    impairment (MCI) or dementia) in males and females over a 22-year follow-up period.

    **Methods:** Participants from The Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), a longitudinal,
    population-based health study in central Norway, were included. NORRISK2 score was
    calculated based on data from The HUNT2 survey (1995-1997). Cognitive status was
    assessed in the sub study HUNT4 70+ (2017-2019), and categorized as normal, MCI or
    dementia. Logistic regression with NORRISK2 score as predictor and cognitive status 22
    years later as dependent variable was used to investigate the associations.

    **Results:** The study sample consisted of 6971 participants, including 42.4% males (mean age
    55.4 years, SD 5.8) and 57.6% females (mean age 56.5, SD 6.6). At HUNT4 70+, 14.0% of
    the participants had developed dementia, and 34.6% had developed MCI. Per one unit
    increase in NORRISK2 score, the odds of developing dementia increased by 12% for males
    (OR=1.12; 95% CI 1.10-1.14) and 22% for females (OR=1.22; 95% CI 1.20-1.25). Odds for
    developing cognitive impairment increased by 6% for men (OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.05-1.08) and
    16% for women (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.14-1.18).

    **Conclusion:** A higher NORRISK2 score was associated with increased risk of dementia and
    cognitive impairment in both males and females, with the strongest associations being found
    in females. The findings suggest that the NORRISK2 score could be used in clinical practice
    not only to predict future risk of CVD, but also as a predictor of risk of dementia and
    cognitive impairment.
