abstract: |
  Space and time are essential elements of episodic or conscious memory, the type of memory that is strongly impaired in Alzheimer's patients. To introduce the symposium, we will go through a historical overview of the structural neurobiology of brain structures that mediate conscious memory. This aims to lead to a perspective of where we boldly should travel to further our elementary knowledge, in service of productive applications.
