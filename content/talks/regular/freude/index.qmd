abstract: |
    The risk to develop sporadic Alzheimerâ€™s disease can be linked to SNPs in innate immunity genes and emerging evidence points towards sex-specific microglial responses. Our work investigates how these factors drive phenotypic changes in microglia to elucidate pathological mechanisms and identify targets for personalized anti-inflammatory therapies.
